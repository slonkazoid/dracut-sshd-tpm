# TPM PCRs (platform control registers) to reference while sealing host keys
# See ArchWiki for a list of registers:
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Trusted_Platform_Module#Accessing_PCR_registers
# Example: `sha256:0,4`
# Required, must be consistent across reboots.
#tpm_pcrs=

# Path to PCR dump to use while creating TPM policy
# The next boot's registers must match for the keys to be unsealed
# You can dump the current ones with the following command:
# root@fedora:~# tpm2_pcrread -o pcr.bin "$tpm_pcrs"
# Not required, will default to reading current register values.
#tpm_pcr_bin=

# List of files and directories to seal
# Paths should be absolute, and root corresponds to the initramfs root
files=()
# You can find and append paths to this array:
#    for key in "${initdir}"/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*_key; do
#	     files+=("${key#${initdir}}")
#    done

# Unseal files before any of these systemd units start
#before="sshd.service NetworkManager.service"

# Require unsealing to happen before these units can be started
#required_by="sshd.service"

# Attempt unsealing when these units are started
#wanted_by="NetworkManager.service"
